        <h3>
			Imperative vs Functional programming
        </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Imperative - describes computation in terms of statements that change a program state. 
			</li>
			<li>
			Functional -  treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data, thus expressing the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.
			</li>
		</ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h3>
			Imperative Example: 
			Count all numbers that can be divided exactly by 5 from 1 to 150.
        </h3>
		<section>
		<pre>
			int sum = 0;
			for (int i = 0; i < 150; i++)
			{
				if (i % 5 == 0)
				  sum += i;
			}
			printf(sum);
		</pre>

        <h3> Advantages of functional programming </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Expressive</li>
            <li>Easy to debug and test</li>
            <li>Easy to scale thus good modularity</li>
            <li>Easy to parallelized, adapt to concurrency well</li>
            <li>Rapid development</li>
            <li>Matchmatically elegant</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Pitfalls of functional programming </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Difficult to learn</li>
            <li>Hard to predict time and space complexity(due to lazyz eval)</li>
            <li>Hard to program for some real life problem because it abstracts from hardware more than imperative</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Problems of imperative programming in Game development </h3>
        <ul class="build">
            <li>Data Race, deadlock</li>
            <li>Scaling requires lots efforts</li>
            <li>Debugging and testing requires lots efforts</li>
            <li>Hard to understand large projects</li>
            <li>Hard to extend modularly</li>

        <h3>Great! Let's just use Functional programming for games then, easy:</h3>
		<section>
		<pre>
            GameLoop( 
                Players(), AIs(), Trees(), Guns(), Bullets(), ... )
		</pre>
		</section>
        <ul class="build">
            <li>Wait a second! Something doesn't seem right here...</li>
            <li>Games have time-varying states</li>
            <li>Game objects interact with each other</li>
            <li>Game objects reacts to physical laws and player IOs</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h3>I got it, give me one more chance, I can still do it, boss!</h3>
		<section>
		<pre>
            gameState = [playerPosition, playerSpeed, 
                        gamepadIO, playerIsColliding, ... ]
            t = currentTime()
            GameLoop( 
                Players(gameState, t), AIs(gameState, t), 
                Trees(gameState, t), Guns(gameState, t), 
                Bullets(gameState, t), ... )
		</pre>
		</section>
        <ul class="build">
            <li>This is ugly! Look at the giantic gameState!</li>
            <li>Mutable GameState variable</li>
            <li>This isn't functional programming, this is imperative!</li>
            <li>Games don't like functional programming, what are we gonna do?</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Functional Reactive programming to the rescue!</h1>
        
      </article>

      <article>
      <span class="blue">Definiation of FRP</span> - functions react to an input signal and returns an updated signal.<br /><br />
        A <span class="red">signal</span> is a type value related to continuous time:
        <pre> Signal a = Time -> a</pre>
        A <span class="red">signal function</span> is a function from Signal to Signal:
        <pre> SF a b = Signal a -> Signal b</pre>
        You can't touch the signals without using sigal functions.
      </article>

      <article>
        <span class="red">Signal function combinators</span> composite function(s) to a Signal Function:
        <img src="images/sf_com.jpg" />
         You can't touch the signal functions without using combinators.
      </article>

      <article>
      <h3>Nice! we can now do:</h3>
        <pre>
signal(position, speed, mouseXY) 
    -> PlayerFunction 
        -> signal(position, speed, mouseXY)
        </pre>
        <div class="build">
            <p>But what about gamepads buttons, collisions etc.?</p> 
            <p>An <span class="red">event</span> is a type to represent discrete events such as a mouse click:
            <pre>data Event a = NoEvent | Event a</pre>
            </p>
        </div>
      </article>

      <article>
      <h3>Looks like we are almost there:</h3>
        <pre>
signal(position, speed, mouseXY), event(gamepad, collision) 
  -> PlayerFunction 
    -> signal(position, speed, mouseXY)
        </pre>
        <div class="build">
            <p>But but but, what if my player dies? How do I remove and spawn?</p>
            <p>Also, how does my object know if it is colliding with each other?</p>
        </div>
      </article>

       
      <article>
          <h3>The last piece of the puzzle: Switches!</h3>
          <span class="red">Switch</span> switches from one subordinate signal function into another when a switching event occurs.
          <pre>
            switch :: SF a (b, Event c) -> 
              (c -> SF a b) -> SF a b
          </pre>
          <div class="build">
              <p>What is this non-sense? What are these strange symbols stand for?</p>
              <p>It's haskell...I know. It says a switch will take an activated signal function with a trigger event, and another signal function as input. If the trigger event occurs, it applies the second signal function, else it applies the original signal function.
          </div>
          </article>
          <article>
          <h3>The big picture</h3>
          We use switches to route events and switch on/off game objects for spawn/kill.

            <p>Q:How well is this method perform?
      <br />
            A:Paul Hudak made a game <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF3bEsKf-Xs">"PaddleBall"</a> with 17 lines of code in FAL</p>
            <p>Q:Is there example of complex game out there made with FRP?
      <br />
            A:Check out <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Frag">Frag</a>, a first personal shooter game</p>
